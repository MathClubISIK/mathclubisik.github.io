Here are a few Guidelines you need to follow

To submit a question, use the form given on the website. We'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. See if your question is more suitable for a StackExchange post or office hours of your instructor We encourage you to try these avenues first but feel free to send your doubts our way.

Fill the form with the following details:

1. Your name and email id (one that you check regularly), so that we may contact you.
2. The question and your current understanding of the problem at hand, possibly including ways in which you tried to tackle the problem (try to be as specific as possible). Doing this may clear the doubt! (Try to use \\(\LaTeX\\) to typeset the math, which is highly recommended, or use clear handwriting for the sake of our mental health)
3. Source of the doubt (if it's a line in a book or lecture notes, a screenshot or pdf).

We will try to get back to you as soon as possible, addressing the doubt the best we can, possibly with a reference that we think may help clear the doubt and/or posting the same on our website where participants and members can try it together.

If you are interested to submit a doubt, fill the following form and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
