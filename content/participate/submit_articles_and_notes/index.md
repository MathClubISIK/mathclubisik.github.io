We encourage you to write articles and notes throughout your time at ISI. If you are interested and do not mind, feel free to contact us and send us your articles/notes. We shall post the same in our website to give easy access to every student of ISIB and beyond. Right now, we shall be accepting the following:

- Articles (pre-print/published) and Expository Notes.
- Additional Notes based on topics of interest (includes alternate proofs, some extra topic, etc.).
- Interesting Problems with attempts at solution (\\(\LaTeX\\) typed or links, former preferred).
- Here are a few Guidelines you need to follow.

### Guidelines for submitting articles or notes

To submit any article or notes on some interesting mathematical topic that you may wish to be put up on the website, write a mail to the official club email address <mathclub.isical@gmail.com> with the subject "Submission of article for club website". Please include with the mail, your name, title of the article, a brief abstract of the article, and the mathematical topics it covers. In case your article is already uploaded on some site such as [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) or [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net), it suffices to share the link of your article. If not, we request you to send a pdf file of your article, preferably written using \\(\LaTeX\\).

Your submission will be reviewed by the appropriate club members, after which you shall be contacted by the club regarding any minor revisions, if needed, within a few days. Once accepted, your article or notes will be put up on the site under Articles section, in pdf form, or the link as submitted by you. We are looking forward to your submissions

### Guidelines for submitting Problem specific notes or problem collections

To submit any problem collection or problem specific notes or any interesting original problem that you may wish to be put up on the website, write a mail to the official club email address mathclub.isical@gmail.com with the subject "Submission of Problem note for club website". In case it is a problem collection already uploaded on some site or blog, it suffices to share the link of the site. If not, we request you to send a pdf file of your problem note, preferrably written using \\(\LaTeX\\). It is highly recommended, that you share some of your own progress or thoughts on the problem(s), as well.
