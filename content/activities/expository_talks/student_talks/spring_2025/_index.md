# Spring 2025

## SL2504: Semi-Circular Law

- **Speaker:** Saraswata Sensarma, M. Math 1st Year
- **Abstract:** [TBA]
- **Video:** [TBA]
- **Date and Time:** [TBA]
- **Venue:** [TBA]

## ST2503: Convergence of random series

- **Speaker:** Ayan Ghosh, B. Stat 2nd Year
- **Abstract:** Discussion on upper and lower bounds on kolmogorov maximal inequality, Hence Proving kolmogorov three series theorem. Discussion on rates of convergence. Finally a theorem(probably by Levy) - Convergence of sum (X_n) in distribution=> almost sure convergence of the series provided X_i independent.
- **Video:** (Not Recorded)
- **Date and Time:** 18th March 2025, 4:30 PM
- **Venue:** Room 401, SN Bose Bhavan


## ST2502: Short Proof of Kolmogorov SLLN

- **Speaker:** Atmadeep Sengupta, B. Stat 2nd Year
- **Abstract:** Strong law of large number gives a justification of thumbs rule of average. It states that sample mean converges to original mean almost surely. The original and traditional proof is due to A.N. Kolmogorov. The alternative elementary proof by N. Etemadi bypasses stuffs like maximal inequalities and convergence of random series. In this talk, we will discuss this proof and have some insight on the elegance of the proof. After that, we will have a proof of another statistic, namely median. We will have a short proof of almost sure convergence of sample median to true median, in the case of unique median.

- **Video:** (Not Recorded)
- **Date and Time:** 12th March 2025, 4:30 PM
- **Venue:** Room 401, SN Bose Bhavan

## ST2501: Dirichlet's Theorem of Primes in an Arithmetic Progression

- **Speaker:** Srijeet Bhattacharjee, B. Stat 2nd Year
- **Abstract:** We know that there are infinitely many primes in natural numbers. But are there infinitely many primes in any arithmetic progression? More generally which arithmetic progressions contain infinitely many primes? We would prove Dirihclet's theorem on primes in an arithmetic progression. We will introduce the concepts of Dirichlet characters and Dirichlet $L$ functions, which gave rise to other general $L$ functions  and studying their properties is an area of the bulk of active research in Analytic number theory and even connected to the Riemann Hypothesis
