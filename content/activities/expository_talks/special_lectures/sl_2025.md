## SL2501: An Introduction to Impartial Games

- **Speaker:** Prof. [Arnab Chakraborty](https://www.isical.ac.in/~arnabc/) (ISI, Kolkata)

These are useful things to know when you sit in the back row during a boring lecture. We shall learn about such games (and the some of the math underlying it) by actually playing the games. You'll get to know about exciting games that you have not possibly heard about before!
