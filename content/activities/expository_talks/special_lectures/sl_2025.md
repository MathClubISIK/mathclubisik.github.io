## SL2501: An Introduction to Impartial Games

- **Speaker:** Prof. [Arnab Chakraborty](https://www.isical.ac.in/~arnabc/) (ISI, Kolkata)
- **Abstract:** Impartial games are where two players alternate moves, and the same set of moves is available to both the players. Typically the player able to move last wins. These are useful things to know when you sit in the back row during a boring lecture. We shall learn about such games (and the some of the math underlying it) by actually playing the games. You'll get to know about exciting games that you have not possibly heard about before!
