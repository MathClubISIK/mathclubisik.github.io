## FC2303: Measure Theory and Probability

- **Audience:** B. Stat, 2nd year students and seniors
- **Abstract:** We will study measures and their properties. Starting with a relatively abstract yet motivated setup, we will try to study measures, the Lebesgue Integration Theory, some major results, product measures and the Radon-Nikdoym Theorem. This would be followed by some convergence issues and probability theoretic applications.
- **Pre-requisites:** Metric Topology, Probability and Riemann Integration.
- **Instructors:**
  - Rishiraj Baul (M. Math, 2024)
  - Soham Mallick (M. Stat, 2024)
- **Schedule:** All sessions will be held from 6:30 PM
  - **Lectures:**
    - Monday, 13th March 2023
    - Wednesday, 15th March 2023

    - Monday, 10th April 2023
    - Monday, 17th April 2023

## FC2302: Metric Spaces and Topology

- **Audience:** Everyone
- **Abstract:** We will cover the very basics of metric spaces and generalise the notion of sequences and continuity. We will also discuss some introductory notions from Point Set Topology.
- **Pre-requisites:** None

## FC2301: Group Theory

- **Audience:** B. Stat, 1st year students
- **Abstract:** This course will be an introduction to the theory of groups, specifically its role in the study of symmetry. We will also be discussing the axiomatic foundations of group theory as well as some number theory.
- **Pre-requisites:** None
- **Instructor:** Snehinh Sen (M. Math, 2024)
- **Schedule:** All sessions will be held from 4:30 PM, unless otherwise mentioned
