## FC2402: Measure Theory and Probability

- **Audience:** B. Stat, 2nd year students and seniors
- **Abstract:** We will study measures and their properties. Starting with a relatively abstract yet motivated setup, we will try to study measures, the Lebesgue Integration Theory, some major results, product measures and the Radon-Nikdoym Theorem. This would be followed by some convergence issues and probability theoretic applications.
- **Pre-requisites:** Metric Topology, Probability and Riemann Integration.
- **Instructors:**
  - [TBA]
- **Schedule:** From 4:30 PM
  - **Lectures:** All sessions will be held from 4:30 PM
    - [TBA]

## FC2401: Group Theory
