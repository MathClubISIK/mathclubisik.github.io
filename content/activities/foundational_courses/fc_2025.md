Can we construct any polygon using only ruler and compass? This course on Galois theory answers these and many more interesting questions by observing certain beautiful connections within mathematics.
- **Pre-requisites:** Basic understanding of Linear Algebra. Additional prerequisites will be developed as needed during the course.
- **Instructors:**
  - Saheb Mohapatra (M. Math, 2025)
  - Sourish Goswami (M. Math, 2025)
