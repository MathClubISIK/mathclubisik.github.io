The [Math Club](/) offers Foundational Courses starting from Spring 2023 for first-year undergrad students. These courses cover essential topics not included in the early semesters of the B. Stat curriculum but are necessary for many talks and projects. All first-year students should attend, as these topics will be important for future Math Club activities and projects. The courses will also provide insights beyond typical textbook content.

These talks are open to everyone at ISI Kolkata and beyond, so all are welcome to join!
