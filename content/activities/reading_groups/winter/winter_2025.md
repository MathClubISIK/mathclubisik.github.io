## Knot Theory

What is a knot and what makes it safe when tied up? We'll be exploring questions of this kind through in this winter group. We plan to rigorously understand what define a 'knot'; 'knotting' and 'unknotting'. To study knots we would like to develop tools like Alexander and Jones Polynomials. Finally if time permits, we might try to touch up on bits & pieces of Khovanov Homology that will put knot theory in perspective with the way it interacts with topology.

## Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry of Curves

Algebraic Geometry is the study of geometric objects, especially locus of zeroes of multivariate polynomials, using methods from algebra. Apart from having several applications in fields like number theory, complex geometry, and mathematical physics, it is also a very rich and thriving field on its own. It is closely related to the more abstract field of Commutative Algebra, which, as the name suggests, is a systematic study of commutative rings and objects related to them (like ideals, modules, algebras, etc.). In this group, we will try to learn the foundations of Commutative Algebra with a very clear focus on its geometric applications. We will mostly focus on curves, especially in the projective setup, and try to prove some fascinating results pertaining to them after developing the necessary algebra. Time permitting, and modulo some assumptions, we will also try to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem for $\mathbb{C}[t]$ (with appropriate interpretation).  
Note: Even though Commutative Algebra is and would be very important for our considerations, we will only be learning the relevant parts for the sake of the geometry. If people are interested, I would be happy to provide references and meet separately to discuss more algebra. However, for the sake of this group, commutative algebra would mostly be the “language” for us to study algebraic curves.

- **Pre-requisites:** A working understanding of rings and fields (at the level of Algebraic Structures course in ISI Kolkata) is very important. Geometric ideas about curves and their tangents are also helpful. Projective Geometric intuition, though not necessary, might be helpful. Same goes for module theory.
